# New Evaluation Rules Implementation Summary

## üéØ **New Evaluation Rules Implemented**

### **Rule 1: Same Symbol on Multiple Paylines**
**Old Rule**: Only consider the highest-paying payline for each symbol
**New Rule**: Sum ALL payline wins for the same symbol

**Implementation**:
- Removed the restriction that prevented multiple payline wins for the same symbol
- Now all payline wins for a symbol are summed together
- Example: SYM3 wins on payline 1 (100 coins) + payline 5 (100 coins) = 200 coins total

### **Rule 2: Same Symbols on Single Payline**
**Old Rule**: Consider any valid combination
**New Rule**: Consider only the highest count on the same payline

**Implementation**:
- For each payline, only the highest count for a symbol is considered
- Example: SYM3 appears 4 times on payline 1, but 3 SYM3 also appears on same payline ‚Üí Only count 4 SYM3 (higher payout)

**Code Change**:
```csharp
// Check if we already have a higher count for this symbol on this specific payline
var existingKeysForThisPayline = counted.Where(k => k.StartsWith($"{baseSymbol}-") && k.EndsWith($"-{string.Join(",", line)}")).ToList();
```

### **Rule 3: Wild and Symbols on Single Payline**
**Old Rule**: Consider wild-only wins separately
**New Rule**: Compare wild-only vs symbol+wild wins, take the highest

**Implementation**:
- Count wilds and symbols separately on each payline
- Calculate both wild-only payout and symbol+wild payout
- Take the higher of the two
- Example: 3 SYM1 (wild) = 200 coins vs 2 SYM3 + 1 SYM1 = 100 coins ‚Üí Take 200 coins (wild-only)

**Code Change**:
```csharp
// Calculate wild-only payout
if (wildCount >= 2 && symbolConfigs.ContainsKey("SYM1") && symbolConfigs["SYM1"].Payouts.TryGetValue(wildCount, out double wildPayout))
{
    wildOnlyPayout = wildPayout;
}

// Calculate symbol+wild payout
if (hasSymbols && symbolType != null && symbolCount >= 3 && symbolConfigs.ContainsKey(symbolType))
{
    int totalCount = symbolCount + wildCount;
    if (symbolConfigs[symbolType].Payouts.TryGetValue(totalCount, out double symbolPayout))
    {
        symbolWithWildPayout = symbolPayout;
    }
}

// Take the higher payout
double payout = Math.Max(wildOnlyPayout, symbolWithWildPayout);
```

## üéÆ **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Multiple Payline Wins**
```
Grid: SYM3 appears on paylines 1, 3, and 5
Old Rule: Only highest-paying payline counted (e.g., 100 coins)
New Rule: All paylines summed (100 + 100 + 100 = 300 coins)
```

### **Scenario 2: Same Symbol Multiple Counts**
```
Payline 1: SYM3 appears 4 times (100 coins) and 3 times (50 coins)
Old Rule: Both counted
New Rule: Only 4 SYM3 counted (100 coins)
```

### **Scenario 3: Wild vs Symbol+Wild**
```
Payline 1: 3 SYM1 (wild) = 200 coins
Payline 1: 2 SYM3 + 1 SYM1 = 100 coins
Old Rule: Both counted separately
New Rule: Only wild-only counted (200 coins, higher payout)
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Key Changes Made**

1. **Payline Evaluation Logic**:
   - Removed global symbol restriction
   - Added payline-specific count checking
   - Implemented per-payline highest count logic

2. **Wild Evaluation Logic**:
   - Separated wild and symbol counting
   - Added comparison between wild-only and symbol+wild payouts
   - Implemented highest payout selection

3. **Consistency Across All Files**:
   - Same logic implemented in all three evaluation files
   - Maintained compatibility with existing code structure
   - Preserved logging and debugging capabilities

### **Performance Impact**
- **Minimal**: Logic changes are efficient
- **No Memory Overhead**: Uses existing data structures
- **Maintains Speed**: Optimized algorithms preserved

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of New Rules**

1. **More Realistic Payouts**: Multiple payline wins are now properly summed
2. **Better Wild Handling**: Wilds are evaluated optimally against symbols
3. **Accurate Count Logic**: Only highest counts per payline are considered
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Same rules across all evaluation contexts
5. **Improved RTP Accuracy**: More precise win calculation for Monte Carlo

## üéØ **Expected Results**

- **Higher RTP**: Multiple payline wins will increase overall RTP
- **Better Wild Utilization**: Wilds will provide optimal payouts
- **More Accurate Simulation**: Monte Carlo results will be more realistic
- **Consistent Gameplay**: All evaluation contexts use the same rules

The new evaluation rules provide more realistic and accurate slot machine behavior, properly handling multiple payline wins, symbol counting, and wild evaluation.
